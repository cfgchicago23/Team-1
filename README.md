# Team-1: [RE]Building Together Aurora

Building Together Aurora is a web application built using React and Firebase, designed for active users to manage their volunteer commitments. Users can sign in, view events they've signed up for, and register for new events through a user-friendly calendar interface.

## Features:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup pages powered by Firebase.
- **Event Dashboard**: View all events you've committed to at a glance.
- **Event Calendar**: Browse and sign up for new events directly from the calendar.
  
## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Firebase project setup.

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd [Your Web App Directory]
   ```
3. **Install the required npm packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up your Firebase configuration**:

   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the root directory.
   - Fill in your Firebase project credentials.

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage:

1. **Signup & Login**: New users can sign up using their email and password. Returning users can log in to access their dashboard.
2. **Dashboard**: After logging in, users can view the list of Building Together Aurora volunteer events they've signed up for.
3. **Calendar View**: Navigate to the calendar to see available events. Clicking on an event provides more details and an option to sign up.
